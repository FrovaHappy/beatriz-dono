description: Some things to know before contributing to Beatriz Dono
---
Hello! Thank you for your interest in contributing to this project. Although we don't have a strict contribution methodology, there are some guidelines you should follow:

## General rules

- Commit names can be in English or Spanish, but must be clear and descriptive.
- Modified or added files should be brief and directly related to the problem being fixed.
- The code must be readable and maintain a minimum of quality. I know my code is not perfect, but it is always good to follow good practices.
- It is mandatory to format the code according to the style conventions of this project. Currently, we use **Biome** for formatting.
- The end-of-line standard (EoLS) is **CRLF**.
- Make sure your branches are synchronized with the main branch (**master**).

## Contribution process

1. **Make a fork or clone** of the repository and work on a separate branch.
2. **Make small, focused changes** to solve a specific problem.
3. **Follow the style rules** and make sure the code is properly formatted before committing.
4. **Synchronize your branch with master before sending a pull request.
5. **Send a pull request (PR)** and briefly describe the changes made.

For the time being, I will be checking and commenting on pull requests if any questions arise.

Thanks for your help and happy programming! ♥️
